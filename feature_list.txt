1. Understanding of Client Requirements
---------------------------------------
The client requires a software system to track company-owned assets
and identify which employee is currently responsible for each asset.
The goal is to maintain accountability and easy visibility of assets.


2. Creative Freedoms Taken
--------------------------
- Product named "AssetTrack"
- Assumed a web-based internal system integrated with HR
- Introduced admin and employee roles
- Expanded scope to include asset history and condition tracking


3. Assumptions Made
-------------------
- Each asset has a unique asset ID
- Each employee has a unique employee ID
- One asset can be assigned to only one employee at a time
- Assets can be reassigned
- Admin manages assets and assignments
- Employees can view their assigned assets
- Assets track condition, location, and depreciation

1. Asset Registration
   - Add and manage company assets with serial numbers and categories

2. Employee Management
   - Integration with HR system for employee details

3. Asset Assignment
   - Assign assets to employees with effective dates

4. Asset Reassignment

5. Questions for Next Client Meeting
------------------------------------
1. What types of assets should be tracked? (Laptops, Furniture, Vehicles, etc.)
2. Should asset condition tracking be mandatory?
3. Do employees need asset request functionality?
4. Is asset return confirmation required?
5. Are reports required for management?
6. Should depreciation calculations be automated?
